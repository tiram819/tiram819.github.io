I remember taking a computer science class in high school, it was very interesting but challenging. It was so exciting to see how with coding I was creating a website. Then when I went to college, I chose computer science as my major and I enjoyed it, but that’s when the economy collapsed, and people were getting laid off in the IT field. I believe almost 70% of the students changed their major, including me. I didn’t want to, but I was so scared that I won’t find a job after graduating from college.

Here I am going back to school to finish the most interesting and challenging subject and I am very proud of myself. Software engineering is so broad and have variety of roles. For example: Front and back end engineer, DevOps engineer, Full stack engineer, Web Developer, etc.

Technology is moving fast. Me as a developer want to learn new programming languages and adapt to the continually changing environment. As a developer I will have the ability to create anything I have in my mind.

I have couple of people in my family who are software engineers. They work in their own time, some of them are traveling, and working from overseas. I have always wanted this flexibility, and I know in this field it’s possible. Most importantly I want to learn more and keep up with the technology.
